<h1 align="center">Snapchat Mass DM Automation Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project is a stealth Snapchat automation bot built for mass Direct Messaging (DM) and “Quick Add” features. Targeted at growth marketers and social media automation professionals, this tool automates outreach on Snapchat while avoiding detection. Whether you’re running promo campaigns or scaling brand exposure, it mimics human behavior and operates through mobile automation environments like Android or iOS simulators (Appium, XCUITest). The goal? To help you reach thousands—without setting off Snapchat's security alarms.


## Core Features:
- **Mobile-Optimized:** Built for Android and iOS automation using Appium and XCUITest, allowing seamless integration with real or emulated devices.
- **Undetectable Behavior:** Uses fingerprint spoofing, random delays, and stealth patterns to stay under Snapchat’s radar.
- **Scalable Outreach:** Manage hundreds of Snapchat accounts and deliver mass DMs or friend requests with dynamic message templates.
